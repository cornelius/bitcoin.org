##### ListSinceBlock
{% include helpers/subhead-links.md %}

{% assign summary_listSinceBlock="get all transactions in blocks since block [blockhash], or all transactions if omitted." %}

{% autocrossref %}

The `listsinceblock` RPC {{summary_listSinceBlock}}

If "blockhash" is no longer a part of the main chain, transactions from the fork point onward are included.

Additionally, if include_removed is set, transactions affecting the wallet which were removed are returned in the "removed" array.

*Parameter #1---blockhash*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "blockhash"
  t: "string"
  p: "Optional"
  d: "The block hash to list transactions since"

{% enditemplate %}

*Parameter #2---target_confirmations:*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "target_confirmations:"
  t: "number (int)"
  p: "Optional<br>Default=1"
  d: "Return the nth block hash from the main chain. e.g. 1 would mean the best block hash. Note: this is not used as a filter, but only affects [lastblock] in the return value"

{% enditemplate %}

*Parameter #3---include_watchonly:*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "include_watchonly:"
  t: "bool"
  p: "Optional<br>Default=false"
  d: "Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')"

{% enditemplate %}

*Parameter #4---include_removed:*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "include_removed:"
  t: "bool"
  p: "Optional<br>Default=true"
  d: "Show transactions that were removed due to a reorg in the \"removed\" array
       (not guaranteed to work on pruned nodes)"

{% enditemplate %}

*Result*

                                              When it's < 0, it means the transaction conflicted that many blocks ago.
        "blockhash": "hashvalue",     (string) The block hash containing the transaction. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.
        "blockindex": n,          (numeric) The index of the transaction in the block that includes it. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.

        <structure is the same as "transactions" above, only present if include_removed=true>
        Note: transactions that were re-added in the active chain will appear as-is in this array, and may thus have a positive confirmation count.
      ],
      "lastblock": "lastblockhash"     (string) The hash of the block (target_confirmations-1) from the best block on the main chain. This is typically used to feed back into listsinceblock the next time you call it. So you would generally use a target_confirmations of say 6, so you will be continually re-notified of transactions until they've reached 6 confirmations plus any new ones
